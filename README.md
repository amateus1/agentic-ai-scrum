## üì± Resulting App (Generated by the CrewAI Agents)

If everything goes well, your resulting app could look **similar** to this.  
Every run, the LLMs get creative and may change the **UI design**,  
but the **core functionality for trading and transactions** remains consistent.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Sample Stock Trading App created by the Crew ***

The latest example generated by the CrewAI run is included in this repo under the `/output` folder.  
The CrewAI-generated app uses a **Gradio UI**.

1. Navigate to the output folder:
   ```bash
   cd output
   
2. Start the Gradio app:
   python app.py
    
    If you prefer a specific port:
        python app.py --server_port 8000

3. Open your browser at:
    http://localhost:8000
    or http://localhost:7860

üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start
Prerequisites

    Python 3.10+

    Azure DevOps organization

    OpenAI API key

    Deepseek API key (optional)

Installation
bash

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/amateus1/crewai-engineering-team.git
cd crewai-engineering-team

# Checkout the stable branch
git checkout ado_improved_wandb

# Install dependencies
pip install uv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

***sample requirements.txt ***
pyyaml
crewai
sqlalchemy>=2.0.0
langchain 
openai

Environment Configuration
bash

# Copy and configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Add your API keys and ADO configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_key
ADO_ORG=your_azure_devops_org
ADO_PROJECT=your_project_name
ADO_PAT=your_personal_access_token

Azure DevOps Webhook Setup

    Navigate to your ADO project settings

    Create a new service hook with Webhook type

    Set the URL to your server's webhook endpoint

    Subscribe to Work item updated events

    Filter for assigned to "Agentic Lead"

https://images/webhook-setup-screenshot.png
Running the Server
bash

# Start the webhook server
python ado_webhook_server.py

# Or run directly for testing
python -m engineering_team.main

üéØ How It Works
1. Backlog Item Creation

Create a work item in ADO with detailed requirements in the description:
markdown

A simple account management system for a trading simulation platform.
The system should allow users to create an account, deposit funds, and withdraw funds.
The system should be bilingual in English and Chinese.

2. Automatic Processing

    AI team analyzes requirements

    Engineering Lead creates technical design

    Backend Engineer implements Python module

    Frontend Engineer builds Gradio UI

    Test Engineer writes comprehensive tests

3. Real-time Updates

    Status comments posted to ADO

    Cost breakdowns provided upon completion

    Weave traces generated for full visibility

4. Delivery

    Complete Python module delivered

    Functional UI application

    Comprehensive test suite

    Bilingual compliance report

üìä Performance Metrics
Metric	Value	Description
Avg. Development Time	2-5 minutes	End-to-end task completion
Cost per Task	$0.10-$0.50	Based on complexity
Token Usage	10K-50K	Across all agents
Success Rate	95%+	Production-ready output
üè¢ Enterprise Features
Cost Control
python

# Real-time cost tracking
PRICING = {
    "openai/gpt-4o": {"in": 2.50, "out": 10.00},
    "deepseek/deepseek-chat": {"in": 0.14, "out": 0.28}
}

Security & Compliance

    No data persistence - all processing is ephemeral

    Azure DevOps native - no external data storage

    Enterprise-grade authentication with ADO PAT tokens

Scalability

    Horizontal scaling with multiple worker instances

    Queue processing for high-volume backlogs

    Rate limiting to control API costs
