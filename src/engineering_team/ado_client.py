🚧 Public Demo Version (Stubbed)

⚠️ Important: Some Azure DevOps integration logic (posting results, cost breakdowns, 
status transitions) has been **stubbed** in this public demo.

The full integration with Azure DevOps, including detailed work item updates and
cost reporting, is only available via **OptimOps.ai** for client engagements.
