🚧 Public Demo Version (Stubbed)

⚠️ Important: The webhook server code has been **stubbed** in this public demo.  

You can still run local demos (`python main.py`) to see CrewAI agents in action.  
The full webhook → ADO → CrewAI → W&B integration is only available 
via **OptimOps.ai** for client engagements.
